In this folder we provide routines and detailed information related to the computation of anisotropic propagation of electrons around a Geminga-like pulsar.
It contains three sample codes (jpnb) for different solution methods (Forward Euler, Operator Splitting and Peachman-Rachford) of the anisotropic diffussion equation.
