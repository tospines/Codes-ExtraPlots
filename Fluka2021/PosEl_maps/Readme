In this repository we provide, in the form of fits files, the spectra of electrons, positrons, H and He at Earth in the models where the pulsar wind nebulae injection of positrons and electrons is parametrized as a single power-law (run_3D-Fluka_BCPositrons_Sigma0.5_H4kpc-JF12_spectrum.fits.gz) and as a broken power-law (run_3D-Fluka_BCPositrons_Sigma0.5_spectrum.fits.gz).
These files can be read as specified in the https://github.com/tospines/Analyses-and-plotting-codes/tree/main/CR_spectra-Plots/Plotting_General_Spectra.ipynb file (also in e.g. https://github.com/tospines/ISAPP-school-2021_HandsOn-DRAGON2/blob/main/plotting_output-Routines/Electrons_positrons.ipynb). 
The full Galaxy maps with the distribution of these particles are available upon request.

We also provide here an example of the xml and source.param input files needed by DRAGON to compute the secondary spectra of these particles and the contribution from a dark matter particle at Earth. More information can also be found at https://github.com/tospines/Customised-DRAGON-versions/tree/main/Custom_DRAGON2_v2-Antinuclei.
